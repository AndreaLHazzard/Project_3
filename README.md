# Tax Lien Data Engineering Project


## Overview of project and purpose:
Isolating specific tax lien data
Why would you use this software?

Understand more clearly municipal and county data, with easier to read and enriched databases. Identify owners that owe back taxes,or have unsatisfied liens against their properties.  Include a method for reading data from the database and displaying it for future uses; in the form of a Pandas Dataframe and console interaction.Help get people out of debt, while buying their land/ real estate with the intention to re-sell. Show the benefits of filtering and combining data sets, while making them more readable. While buying their land/ real estate with the intention to re-sell. 


What could you use this for?

You could look how this is setup, and apply similar formatting and workflow to accommodate filtering and modifying other property data website’s csv files.


### Installing
For best performance download VScode.

### Instructions on how to use and interact with the project:

Open delivery.ipynb in VScode.

Look through some examples of visuals that you could add to and modify if you wanted to follow the framework.
In the console(the area with the magnifying glass and the word Search) at the top middle of the IDE a message will prompt you to enter an area code.
When you do so the information about that area code will be returned.
OR 
If you incorrectly enter a zip code, or enter a zip code outside of Allegheny County an error code will be returned.

## Ethical considerations made in the project:
This is a tool and we realize that tools can be used in any way that the imagination can come up with. We have considered that the data as we have combined, sorted and transformed it could be used to negatively impact people's lives. People could be convinced with technical language that they have no choice but to sell their land. 
There are also many positive, and community forward opportunities in using this tool or one similar to it.  Someone using this tool could offer to provide legal counsel (or resources) to parties that have an outstanding lien against their property. Simply informing people of their tax status in innovative ways could help add value to a property owner’s situation (especially if they are unable to be reached by Post or Email, or phone). Many people are left property in wills or are simply unaware that they have land in their name, in this case using this project as a tool to inform people of their tax status with the government is another community improving use case.
As with all tools, they can cut both ways and we implore you to leave the world a better place than you found it.
